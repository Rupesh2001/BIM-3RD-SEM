<h1 id="badminton">Badminton</h1>
<p>
  The invention of Badminton originates back to at least two thousand years ago, 
  where is was a combination of the games battledore and shuttlecock played in ancient Greece, 
  India, and China. 
  "It is known that around 1860, the daughters of the Duke of Beutfort were playing Battledore and Shuttlecock in the great hall of Badminton house, the seat of the Somerset family in Gloucestershire, England. To add a little variety, they rigged up a string across the hall from the doorway to the fireplace and the aim of the game was to try to keep the shuttle going by playing it to each other over the string. It is believed that Mr. J L Baldwin suggested that it would be more amusing if the shuttle were to be hit away from instead of towards players on the other side of the string. The sport of badminton had been created.
  "Gloucestershire is now the foundation for the International Badminton Federation. 131 countries are members of the IBF today.
             "The American Badminton Association was organized in 1936 (changed to USBA in 1978), when Donald Wilbur, Robert McMillan, and twins Donald and Phillip Richardson, all from Brookline, Massachusetts, decided to combine the nation's various badminton groups. Programs from New York, Massachusetts, Chicago, and the West Coast came together to form one set of rules and regulations of the game". Nine members from Canada, Denmark, England, France, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales founded the International Badminton Federation two years earlier. After badminton's first appearance at the Olympics in Barcelona, it seemed to increase in popularity. The first major IBF tournament was the Thomas Cup in 1948. Since then, the number of world events has increased with the addition of the Uber Cup (ladies' team), World Championships, Sudirman Cup (mixed team), World Juniors and the World Grand Prix Finals.</p>

<p>         Basketball was invented in the United States in 1891and quickly became popular. Basketball is the one of the major world sport developed in the United States. The official basketball rules for 1966-1967 describe the sport as follows: "Basketball is played by two teams of five players each. The purpose of each team is to throw the ball into it own basket and to prevent the other team from scoring. The ball may be thrown, rolled, dribbled in any direction, subject to restrictions laid down in... rules." Basketball is usually played indoors but can be played level surfaces outdoors. More people watch basketball game than any other sport in the United States other than football. The Olympic games have included basketball since 1936.

<h1 id="football">Football</h1>
<p>   In my opinion one of the most fascinating sports in the world is American Football. I have played football my whole life from age five till last year, I had to stop because I moved here and there is no football. Not to brag or anything but I think that I am an excellent football player, well at least I hope so seeing that I played for eleven years. Football was kind of a complicated sport when I first started playing, eleven different positions on offense and eleven different positions on defense. The field is broken up by yards and every ten yards a line is chalked throughout the whole field. On the sideline off the field these lines are marked with numbers, these numbers are as follows 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10. The fifty yard line is in the middle of the field and there is an end zone with a goal post and either end of the field (by the 10 yard lines).
             The offensive back field consists of a quarterback which is the leader of the team, a half back and a full back. The offensive line has a right tackle, a right guard, a center, a left guard and a left tackle. Also there are wide receivers which line up about 5 yards away from the offensive line and tight ends which line up next to the tackles (they are sometimes not even used). There has to always be eleven players on the field and at least seven players on the line of scrimmage. The line of scrimmage is an imaginary line that goes straight across the field to show what yard line the ball is on. The offense is in control of the ball and they can either run or pass the ball. The running backs (half back and full back) usually run the ball, although the quarterback or even the wide receiver can run the ball on a trick play. The quarterback also has the option to throw the ball to the half back, full back, tight end or wide receiver (the wide receivers usually get thrown to the most)..</p>
